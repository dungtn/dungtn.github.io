### Deconstruct the skill. Self-correct. Remove barriers to learning. Practice at least 20 hours

Inspired by the TED talk [The first 20 hours -- how to learn anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY) by Josh Kaufman, I decide to quickly sketch out a simple website with Jekyll. And the result, can you guess? Yes, it's this personal page, isn't it beautiful?

The thing is, Jekyll is real "simple" and quite "classic", which makes it a wonderful "new thing" to learn. So, here we go :)

1. **Deconstruct the skill** (you might want to keep a stickynote near)
  * know it directory structure 
  * Mardown [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
  * fork a Jekyll repo of your choice ~ take [mine](https://github.com/dungtn/dungtn.github.io), for example :P
2. **Self-correct**
  * modify the code and always look up Jekyll documentation first (don't Google right away, try to _think_ first)
3. **Remove barriers to learning**
  * find a cozy spot :)
  * allow yourself time
4. **Practice at least 20 hours**
  * well, the hardest part :)

Thank you!
